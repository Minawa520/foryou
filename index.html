                    <p>Hey My friend</p>
                    <p>You came into my life unexpectedly</p>
                    <p>It started with my comment on Mr.Joe's post</p>
                    <p>Thanks for sending a direct message when you looked at the comment</p>
                    <p>have you thought how happy I am to know you?</p>
                    <p>You have to know that I am really happy</p>
                    <p>7 months already, we've known each other</p>
                    <p>Sharing stories we have</p>
                    <p>Making every enjoyable chat together</p> 
                    <p>We haven't met in person</p>
                    <p>You are my internet friend</p>
                    <p>But you can make our friendship like we are close friends</p>
                    <p>I feel so lucky that you came into my life</p>
                    <p>Being a part of my life story</p>
                    <p>You bring light colors and paint on it</p>
                    <p>Sharing your happy things can turn my mood into a good mood</p>
                    <p>It can make me smile and feel happy as well</p>
                    <p>But I am really Sorry</p>
                    <p>I can't give you the same things</p>
                    <p>you already know about the reason, right!?</p>
                    <p>And I feel bad to always share about the bad and sad things I have for you</p>
                    <p>I am sorry for that and I also want to say sorry if I ever hurt you</p>
                    <p>Yet, please don't stop sharing your happy things with me</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>We don't know yet how life drift us later</p>
                    <p>Will we always be together and keep sharing?</p>
                    <p>or will it be restricted by the time or something else?</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, I hope we will have enough time to chat a bit</p>
                    <p>Even thought we are too busy</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>Chantal</p>

                    <p></p>
                    <p>It's your birthday</p>
                    <p>I can't give you something better as a present</p>
                    <p>I can just give you this thing, these words</p>
                    <p>I hope you like it</p>
